# My Website

This uses the [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator.
However, currently the zola part is pretty minor and it is mostly styled
using HTML.

## Usage
This should all be done in the `zola` directory
- `make build` to generate the html
- `make deploy` copies it a directory up
- `make git` adds the generated files to git

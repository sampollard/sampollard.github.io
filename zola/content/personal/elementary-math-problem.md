Somehow, 20 years later, I find myself thinking about a math problem I got
in... third grade, perhaps? The problem was, as I remember, something like
this.

> An builder designs a school with several buildings and fields surrounding it.
> Once the buildings are built and the grass planted, he then waits six months
> before building walkways. Why is this?

The point of this is to get kids to think laterally. Why was it in a math
textbook? I have no idea. The author must have gotten cheeky or something.
Well, my dad being a construction worker, answered in the most logical way I
could think of.

> The builder probably left to do another job or maybe the people who hired him
> didn't pay so he stopped working until they paid him.

I got this wrong because the answer was, instead,

> The builder waited six months to see where the people would walk and natural
> walkways started to appear, so he would build sidewalks there.

More than likely the textbook also said "other answers are acceptable" but my
teacher may have overlooked that fact so I got the problem wrong and am
complaining about it to this day.
